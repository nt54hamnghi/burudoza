The plot of the mean price grouped by the manufactured year (`YearMade`) indicates that, except for the 1920-1960 timeframe, the more recently a machine is produced, the higher its expected sale price. 

However, the average price suddenly dropped from 2008 moving forwards, potentially due to the 2008 financial crisis. 

Also, several abnormal spikes that appeared from 1920 to 1960 are attributable to the lack of data points. The boxplot helps justify this; the issues between 1920 and 1960 are all outliers.
