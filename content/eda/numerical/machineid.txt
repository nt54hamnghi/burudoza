The feature is the unique numerical identifier of a machine, and one bulldozer can be listed for auction multiple times.

The scatter plot of the price versus Machine ID (the left chart) looks random. The price range remains the same for all values of the ID. This behavior is understandable; a unique ID should not affect the target variable.

However, how many times a machine was sold could be a good indicator. The scatter plot on the right displays the relationship between a bulldozer's price and sale counts. A machine's price drops if people purchase it over and over again.

The counts are scaled so that they are within 0 and 1. Since we are counting, a machine can appear 30 times in the training data but only 2 or 3 times in the validation data. This difference is due to the difference in size between the two sets. Scaling compensates for the difference and ensures the data stay comparable.
