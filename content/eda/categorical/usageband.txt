`UsageBand` describes the usage of a machine compared to the model line's average (`fiBaseModel`). The possible values are "high," "medium," and "low." For example, a model-X machine with "low" usage means its usage is below the average of all bulldozers of model X.

The box plot (on the left) shows that as usage moves from "low" to "medium" and then "high," the mean sale price increase accordingly. 

However, as shown in the histogram, most bulldozers have a "medium" UsageBand, and when the log of the sale price is above 10, these machines take up the highest proportion.
